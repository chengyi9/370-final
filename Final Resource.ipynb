    "## Project Description\n",
    "> An issue that persists in modern day is abusive alcohol consumption by adolescents. These adolescents tend to start drinking at a very young age for various physical, emotional, and lifestyle changes. Puberty and learning how to live independently often contribute to the commence of alcohol consumption. However, due to the immature mindset that most adolescents have during these early ages, they tend to make bad decisions regarding anything they might term as _\"risky\"_ or _\"cool\"_, such as consuming large amounts of alcohol to get drunk. In fact, **51%** of junior and senior high school students have had at least one drink within the past year and **8 million students drink weekly**. **More than 3 million students drink alone**, **more than 4 million drink when they are upset**, and **less than 3 million drink because they are bored**. In addition, parents, friends, and alcoholic beverage advertisements influences studentsâ€™ attitudes about alcohol. Students' drinking habit is often heavily influenced by their surroundings and is likely impacted by the local student culture and norms. As such, we wanted to analyze this issue in further detail by analyzing all the possible variables that could potentially have an effect on student alcohol consumption, such as personal statistics, parent statistics and education values, and produce a model to help predict student drinking rates based on these features.\n"

    "> The Student Alcohol Consumption data set is found on the Kaggle website. The data was obtained in a survey of student's math and portuguese language courses in the secondary school. In the data set, there are more than thirty features about the student, such as the gender, the age, as well as whether the student is engaged in a romantic relationship. The website also provided us with two data sets; one dataset contained students from a math course, and the other dataset contained students from a Portuguese language course. We will be using those data to predict the alcohol consumption of a student within a week. "

    "> The Drinking per Week Index (DWI) is a index that measures the amount of alcohol a student consumes throughout the entire week. We computed this number by combining the weekday alcohol consumption index and the weekend alcohol consumption index and multiplying by their weights accordingly. This index ranges from one to five, where five represents high alcohol consumption and one represents low alcohol consumption. This index allows us to convert categorical variable to continous variable, which is apropos for running a regression model. \n",

    "#### Social Index\n",
    "> A study done by healthtalk on drugs and alcohol suggests that most high school and college students drink to socialize with others, to have fun and relax. When junior/senior high school students and college students go out with their friends, it is usually to grab some drinks and attend a party. Students tend to drink at abnormally high raters their first year of college when they move out of the house. Students iwth access to the internet tends to utilize social media at high rates, and as such is closely associated with how social a student is. Additionally, whether a student is in a relationship or not strongly dictates how social they are, as relationships usually mandate meeting your partner's friends, hanging out with your partnet often, and attending various events with your partner and your/their friends. Engaging in extra-curriculat activities has a negative correlation with respect to how social a student is, as a student entertained in more extra-curricular activities will likely _NOT_ have time to socialize with others. As such, we decided to create the **Social Index** feature, which indicates how social a given student is based on how often they go out with friends, whether they have access to the internet (1=yes, 0=no), whether they are in a romantic relationship (1=yes, 0=no), and whether they are doing any extra-curricular activities (1=yes, 0=no).
