    "## Project Description\n",
    "> An issue that persists in modern day is abusive alcohol consumption by adolescents. These adolescents tend to start drinking at a very young age for various physical, emotional, and lifestyle changes. Puberty and learning how to live independently often contribute to the commence of alcohol consumption. However, due to the immature mindset that most adolescents have during these early ages, they tend to make bad decisions regarding anything they might term as _\"risky\"_ or _\"cool\"_, such as consuming large amounts of alcohol to get drunk. In fact, **51%** of junior and senior high school students have had at least one drink within the past year and **8 million students drink weekly**. **More than 3 million students drink alone**, **more than 4 million drink when they are upset**, and **less than 3 million drink because they are bored**. In addition, parents, friends, and alcoholic beverage advertisements influences studentsâ€™ attitudes about alcohol. Students' drinking habit is often heavily influenced by their surroundings and is likely impacted by the local student culture and norms. As such, we wanted to analyze this issue in further detail by **analyzing all the possible variables that could potentially have an effect on student alcohol consumption**, such as personal statistics, parent statistics and education values, and **produce a model to help predict student drinking rates based on these features**.\n"

    "> We obtained this Student Alcohol Consumption dataset from Kaggle. The data was attained in a **survey by students of ages 15-22** in regards to their math and/or portuguese language courses during their secondary school education at Gabriel Pereira or Mousinho da Silveira. In the data set, there are **more than thirty features about the student**, such as the gender, the age, as well as whether the student is engaged in a romantic relationship ('Social Index' and 'Drinking Index' in the table below are variables we created, further explained in the 'New Variables' section). The website provided us with two data sets: one dataset contained **students from a math course**, and the other dataset contained **students from a Portuguese language course**. We will be using both of these datasets to **predict the student weekly alcohol consumption rates**. A sample of the dataset features can be seen below: "

    "> Upon analyzing both datasets, we were glad to find that there were **no missing information**. As such, we did not need to worry about any significant data manipulation of the actual data obtained. The only data manipulation we had to perform was **combining the 2 datasets**: the math course dataset and the Portugese language course dataset. Because we were analyzing the rates of drinking based on various students' personal features, and since we came to a consensus that the **type of course would _NOT_ have a significant impact on the the amout a student drinks**, we combined the rows in both the dataframes to create a large dataframe (**1044 rows**) so that we have **more data to determine a stronger model to predict the student weekly drinking rates**.

    "> The **Drinking per Week Index (DWI) is an index that measures the amount of alcohol a student consumes throughout the entire week**. From the dataset given, we wanted a way of measuring alcohol consumption rates in the entire week. As such, the best way to go about this was to combine both weekday and weekend indexes and find the average of these indexes. However, since both indexes are weighted differently, we had to take that into account when finding the average of the weekday and weekend alcohol consumption index by multiplying each index by the number of days there are  in the given variable divided by the number of days there are in a week (as shown below). This **DWI ranges from one to five, where five represents high alcohol consumption and one represents low alcohol consumption**. Ultimately, the DWI allows us to convert categorical variables into a continuous variable, which we can use to run a statisticsl regression model and make predictions about how much alcohol a student consumes in the entire week. \n"

    "#### Social Index\n",
    "> A study done by healthtalk on drugs and alcohol suggests that **most high school and college students drink to socialize with others, to have fun and relax**. When junior/senior high school students and college students go out with their friends, it is usually to grab some drinks and attend a party. Students tend to drink at abnormally high raters their first year of college when they move out of the house. Students with access to the internet tend to utilize social media at high rates, and as such are closely associated with how social students are. Additionally, whether a student is in a relationship or not strongly dictates how social they are, as relationships usually mandate meeting your partner's friends, hanging out with your partnet often, and attending various events with your partner and your/their friends. Engaging in extra-curriculat activities has a negative correlation with respect to how social a student is, as a student entertained in more extra-curricular activities will likely _NOT_ have time to socialize with others. As such, **we decided to create the Social Index feature, which indicates how social a given student is based on how often they go out with friends, whether they have access to the internet (1=yes, 0=no), whether they are in a romantic relationship (1=yes, 0=no), and whether they are doing any extra-curricular activities (1=yes, 0=no).** We created the social index formula based on how each feature correlates with the the DWI. Below is the formula to determine the Social Index:"

    "> The distribution of students' social index graph (illustrated above) allows us to visually see how social most students in the dataset are. **A lower social index indicates lower social interactions and thus, a less social student. On the contrary, a higher social index indicates many more social interactions with others likely from going out often with friends, a more social student.** The graph illustrates that most students are social to some extent, with very few people being completely anti-social (as there are only ~100 students with a social index less than 0.5. The remaining are somewhat social (with an index of 0.5 - 1.0) or very social (with an index of 1.2 to 1.29), which makes sense since most students as this age tend to be very social to gain popularity. We believe that **this desire to be popular has a strong correlation with drinking**, as most \"cool\" people partake in some illegal activities like underage drinking, which a student who would want to be deemed as \"cool\" and be a \"popular kid\" would have to engage in these illegal activities.

Since we are trying to predict categorical variables (level of students' alcohol consumption from 1 to 5 with 1 being very low (less and 5 being very high); we decided to use decision tree classifier, random forest classifier, and support vector classifier as our primary machine learning algorithms with multi-class logistic regression as a benchmark for comparison. We believe that decision tree based algorithms like decision tree classifier & random forests  classifier are best suited for this type of classification problem since a significant portion of our independent/expanatory variables are categorical in nature.

    "#### Decision Tree Learning \n",
    "> Decision tree learning is one of the most predictive modeling approaches in data mining and machine learning. It is a simple and widely used classification technique. In essence, the decision tree organizes a series of test questions and conditions just like a tree structure. Starting from the root node, we implemented the test condition, and thereby seperated the data into two groups. From there, we apply different test condition on the different subset until the data is entirely classified into smaller subsets. One of the major adventages of a decision tree model is that it is very intuitive and relatively straight-forward, which we thought might potentially render a more accurate model. In addition, nonlinear relationships between parameter do not affect tree performance. Nonetheless, without proper pruning and feature engineering, the tree tends to overfit the training data, which would drastically affect the predicted outcome. "

    "The random forest algorithm pools in predictions and incorporate much more knowledge and accuracy than a single Tree Classifier. It's main advantage is that the model does not get swayed by a single anomalous data source, hence, the predcition will be more accurate and normally distributed, which we hope will produce a more accurate model."
